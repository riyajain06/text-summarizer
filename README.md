# text-summarizer
This project involves building a text summarizer that uses Transformer models for summarization and Beautiful Soup for web scraping. Here's a brief overview:

Key Components:

1. Beautiful Soup for Web Scraping
   Extracts text content from websites (e.g., articles, blog posts).
   Handles parsing of HTML and cleans the text to remove unwanted tags or elements (e.g., ads, navigation).

3. Transformer Model for Summarization
   Pre-trained models like BERT, T5, or Bart are used for generating concise summaries.
   Hugging Faceâ€™s transformers library is typically used for this purpose.

5. Workflow:
   Input: URL of a webpage.
   Scraping: Beautiful Soup fetches and cleans the textual data from the webpage.
   Preprocessing: The extracted text is cleaned and tokenized for the Transformer model.
   Summarization: The Transformer model generates a summary based on the input text.
   Output: A concise and readable summary of the article.
